 * This header is intentionally thin: it only forward-declares the types
 * it needs and exposes function prototypes that take pointers. It must
 * NOT include <linux/memcontrol.h>, since this header is included from
 * <linux/mm_inline.h>, which is included from memcontrol.c itself --
 * pulling the full memcontrol.h in here would risk a circular include.
 * Any code that needs the full definition of struct mem_cgroup (or
 * needs to dereference memcg->mpc) belongs in mpc.c, not in this header.
